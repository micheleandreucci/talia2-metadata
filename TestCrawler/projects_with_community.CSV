It aims to kickstart a process of policy change at regional level in the involved areas resulting in the integration of successful elements into the new Cohesion policy (EU2020+). The overall objective is to positively influence, adapt/change the different structural elements of policy governing ""clusters with high social vocation and responsiveness"" (SVRC) by leveraging on innovation dynamics led by technology, open data & successful models with social relevance & impact, creating socially-responsive value chains at a transnational level. SVRC are usually codified only at local level, so the project addresses the transnational dimension as networking and capacity building approach to achieve a critical mass, increase horizontal opportunities for SMEs, mobility, employability and for scaling up into Cohesion Policy and Funds. It is an integrated project that establishes a structural approach to policy & practice improvement of emerging dynamics in social innovation through an overarching process based on the intertwined use of open data & the creation of a transnational socially-responsive value chain. This includes studying existing initiatives, adapting and testing, with the final objective of capitalizing them in the MED area.";Veneto Region ñ Operational Unit for EU and State Relations;ITALY;30123;2nd call;01/02/2018;31/01/2022;Integrated project;2.667.650,20;119.100,13;3.278.529,80;85%;Social and Creative

Main change sought is to improve basic conditions for bridging the gap among the MED maritime clusters and within their 4helixes thanks to the collaboration with the non-institutional new agents of innovation such as fablabs, co-working spaces, makerspaces, creative hubs, etc. For sustaining innovation in Blue Growth, beside typical research facilities, it is imperative to favour its partnership with and within open spaces for exploratory interaction and creativity that may find room in this new kind of innovation agents. This innovative partnership is also empowered by the groundbreaking combination with Cultural&Creative Industries knowledge and expertise. The enhanced 8 MED maritime regional clusters (Lisbon Region, Andaluzia, Cataluna, PACA region, Marche, Zadar County, Central Macedonia and Durres, Vlora, Saranda & Shengjin coastal areas in Albania) can, thus, be fruitfully involved in the testing, evaluation and regional/national transferring of a transnational innovation process according to an open source, knowledge sharing and community-based approach. 500.000,00Ä out of 2.193.983,75Ä ñ the project overall amount ñ are allocated to innovation vouchers for MED blue SMEs/startups.;SVIM-SVILUPPO MARCHE SPA;ITALY;60125;2nd call;01/02/2018;30/07/2020;Testing;1.720.636,95;144.249,25;2.193.983,75;85%;Blue Growth
3;2;ACT4LITTER;Joint measures to preserve natural ecosystems from marine litter in the Mediterranean Protected Areas;Many Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas (MPA) affirm that Marine Litter (ML) represents one of the major threats for the protection of biodiversity and marine ecosystems and confirmed the lack of knowledge and skills on how to effectively tackle this issue at their level.  ML is a priority of the Euro-Mediterranean policies for sustainable development. Recently, many actions have been implemented but these policy commitments still need to be translated into the MPA context. ACT4LITTER will aim at reviewing the most promising proposed measures and select the ones that could be implemented in the MPA , considering particularly  the ecosystem services. The selection of measures will result in the development of MPA-specific action plans whose implementation could be the object of a future project. In addition, those plans will be complemented, by a realistic and operational governance plan at transnational level. MPA stakeholders and key experts of ML value chain will be involved all through the process in order to validate the outputs together. The action plans will have a strong focus on preventive measures, using circular economy and sustainable consumption and production approaches. The issue of ML is global but MPAs are directly affected by its increasing amount, restraining highly the achievement of the conservation goals.;Catalan Waste Agency - Regional Activity Center for Sustainable Consumption and Production;SPAIN;8017;1st call;01/02/2017;31/10/2018;Studying;457.767,14;0,00;538.549,58;85%;Biodiversity Protection
3;1;ALTER ECO;Alternative tourist strategies to enhance the local sustainable development of tourism by promoting Mediterranean Identity;The Mediterranean is under threat due to the inappropriate practice and development associated with mass tourism. Consequently, areas of high tourist pressure in coastal cities are reaching their limit on carrying capacity, with a direct impact not only on the urban environment but also on key elements that define MED Culture. In this context, ALTER ECO enhances the local sustainable development of tourism by promoting Mediterranean identity, through the implementation of alternative tourist strategies in six pilots co-designed and implemented by public and private stakeholders. The project provides the opportunity of testing, in representative MED cities, used as living lab, existing methodologies and tools arisen in previous high impact projects in the field of sustainable tourism or proposed by key stakeholders, with the aim of reaching holistic and realistic tourist strategies at local and regional level that allow transferability in the MED territory. Project results will support policy makers to make more informed and integrated decisions for the governance and management of tourism in the Mediterranean and at the same time will enhance the coordination of actions between public and private stakeholders towards the implementation of the raised strategies in order to create new business opportunities. ALTER ECO will contribute to improve knowledge and decision making capacities, including a better use of observation, monitoring and planning in the field of sustainable tourism.;Valencia Institute of Building;SPAIN;46018;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;1.949.585,49;0,00;2.293.630,00;85%;Sustainable Tourism
3;2;AMAre;Actions for Marine Protected Areas;"In the Mediterranean Sea, the intensive use of maritime space calls for integrated management to avoid cumulative impacts and user conflicts. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) ñ the harmonisation of human activities in marine areas ñ is considered a powerful approach to reach these goals. However, most Mediterranean countries have not yet gone through this process. The objectives of this project are: 1 ñ to develop shared methodologies and geospatial tools for multiple stressors assessment, coordinated environmental monitoring, multi criteria analyses and stakeholders' engagements;  2 ñ to translate these guidelines into concrete pilot actions and coordinated strategies in selected Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to solve conflict hot spots that affect marine biodiversity and the services it provides. Transnational cooperation and regulations, development of coordinated best practices to deal with present and future drivers of changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services, coordinated monitoring, data access to share information and concrete stakeholder and users' involvement are the expected results. The final aim is to scale up strategies and recommendations at transnational level adopting an ecosystem-based approach to MSP considering the goals of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) across MPAs.

1;1;ARISTOIL;Reinforcement of Mediterranean olive oil sector competitiveness through development and application of innovative production and quality control methodologies related to olive oil health protecting properties;The Mediterranean region is the main world producer of olive oil, with 95% of the total world's olive oil production. It is mainly produced in Greece, and the Peloponnese region altogether is responsible for 65% of Greek olive oil. Furthermore, the Italian regions of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia and Andalusia in Spain, have the biggest olive growing area on the planet. The main common challenge for all participating countries in the project is the low average price of olive oil in comparison to the production cost and the strong competition with the non-Mediterranean seed oil sector. The producers in the Mediterranean are under pressure either to reduce even more the cost of production or to increase the value or the demand for olive oil in the international market in order to maintain the viability and sustainability of the olive tree cultivation and the olive oil production. The main objective of ARISTOIL is to reinforce the Mediterranean olive oil sector competitiveness, through the development and application of innovative production and quality control methodologies leading to olive oil with enhanced health protecting properties (as recognized by EU 432/2012 regulation). The development of a Mediterranean Cluster for olive oil producers and businesses combined with specialised training, the development of innovative methods for identifying the phenolic ingredients of the oil as well as special product certification to support oil producers' is the mixture, which will lead to the project's objective.;EGTC Efxini Poli - SolidarCity NETWORK;GREECE;13674;1st call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Studying and Testing;1.706.970,00;0,00;2.008.200,00;85%;Green Growth

3;1;BLUEISLANDS;Seasonal variation of waste as effect of tourism;Blue Islands Project brings together 14 partners from 8 countries in a systematic effort to properly identify, address and mitigate the effects of the seasonal variation of waste generation on MED islands as an effect of tourism.  The issue has been a vexing problem for years but it has never before been approached methodically: The quantity and composition of waste generated over a twelve-month period on nine MED islands will be measured and the correlation between the quantified waste generated and both the number of tourists and the presence of litter in the coastal environment will be examined. At the same time, the existing waste management structure and followed respective practices will be assessed. Based on the report prepared from the results derived from all nine islands a multidimensional tool will be formulated, encompassing action plans, through which this common problematic phenomenon can most effectively be addressed. Over a following twelve-month period the tool will be implemented with selected action plans for each participating island, while the efficacy of each action plan will be evaluated.  Eventually, a final report entailing all derived data and experience will showcase the most efficient and successful ways to turn a difficult and burdensome issue for MED islands' communities into a means fueling the establishment of circular economies while preserving and perpetuating sustainable tourism to the Mediterranean.;Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment - Department of Environment;CYPRUS;2025;1st call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Studying and Testing;2.342.022,35;0,00;2.755.320,41;85%;Sustainable Tourism

This is the aim of the CAMARG project testing a brand new and easy web-based service to support clusters of small local producers of agrifood excellences in organising self-sustaining supply networks able to deliver daily the selected food to the consumer locations.  The CAMARG actors are then producers, namely farmers, food artisans and small retailers, feeding the eCatalogue with their offer  customers, namely elderly, sick or busy people as well as tourists, willing to have the bought food delivered at home, office or hotel  and carriers, namely small hauliers provided with cooled vans, covering the picking and delivery routes.  The deployment of the CAMARG service at the local scale will enable producers to finally overcome the hard market competition with the emerging mass retail business model asking for large quantities of few standard-quality product types, while they are normally small sized, many in number and each able to supply limited quantities of very high-quality selected products.  Of course different regions present different conditions for the uptake of the CAMARG service. Starting from the available basic technology the transnational nature of the CAMARG project will help developing an improved solution suitable to be configured and adapted to grasp at best the specific needs of every possible exploitation territory in the European MED area.;Consorzio IB Innovation;ITALY;40010;1st call;01/02/2017;31/07/2019;Testing;1.700.974,96;0,00;2.001.146,24;85%;Green Growth

2;1;CESBA MED;CESBA MED Sustainable MED Cities;Energy efficiency improvement is a key strategy to reduce the environmental impact of public buildings. But usually energy efficiency plans do not fully exploit the potential for synergies that groups of buildings might offer. Energy efficient measures and their implementation at neighbourhood level (i.e. district heating, PV installations, etc) are showing  clearly that a building scale approach is not optimal in reaching significant and cost-effective improvements. However at neighbourhood scale, decision making processes and the design of the intervention are more complex. Many EU  projects  addressed this issue proposing different methodologies, tools and indicators. CESBA MED intends to test 10 of them and to select the most affordable and operational solutions. On the base of the test results' evaluation, a common sustainability assessment framework at urban scale, a set of 8 regional assessment tools (CESBA MED SNTool) and an innovative decision making process will be defined to support the development of energy efficiency plans for public buildings in the context of their surrounding neighbourhoods. CESBA SNTool will  allow to produce the  MED Passport to compare the performances of buildings and neighbourhoods, in line with the EC COM 2014 445. A CESBA MED network of cities will be set up to maximise results' transferability. Training courses and workshops will be organized in the MED area.

In order to highlight different obstacles to RES planning and provide measures to overcome them complementary pilot actions in different countries will be implemented to tackle obstacles for the social acceptance of RES, and for the local development planning, development of local business according to new business models with RES at the core.Results will upgrade existing methods and approaches to RES planning to make a simple and comprehensive model called: COMPOSE - model for RES development planning.It will promote this concept to decision makers at different levels and also provide a concrete training for experts dealing with development planning on a daily basis.A policy paper to mainstream the results and a Memorandum of understanding will be delivered as part of the sustainability of the project.;Slovene Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry - Institute of Agriculture and Forestry Maribor;SLOVENIA;2000;1st call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Testing and Capitalising;1.905.580,17;262.977,25;2.551.244,00;85%;Renewable Energy
3;2;ConFish;Connectivity among Mediterranean fishery stakeholders and scientists resolves connectivity of fishery populations;In this era of fast global change, defining connectivity and adaptive potential of exploited marine stocks while estimating social impacts of change to the livelihood of those who directly exploit the resource are challenging but key requirements towards sustainability of fisheries. Yet, these three levels of information are not captured by traditional management practices: boundaries of stocks are perceived as static, stocks are considered as non-evolving units, and local stakeholders are seldom accounted for at the decision-making level. Here, we create a Mediterranean-based network that includes local stakeholders, social scientists and fisheries scientists, to deliver a framework that will refine the efficiency of fisheries management. The project includes cutting edge genomics techniques - that provide high resolution insights in the connectivity and adaptation - and local stakeholder involvement through all the phases of the framework - to promote the capacity building and knowledge transfer between fishermen and scientists. The concept will be backed-up by a strong social component that will act as a vehicle to bridge and disseminate.

This creates relevant  economic and employment opportunities, but generates at the same time negative externalities that threaten the preservation of those ecosystem services that ensure tourism attractiveness. The development of a sustainable tourism in coastal cities is thus a strategic issue in the MED area.  The CONSUME-LESS project faces this issue by demonstrating the effectiveness of a sustainable tourism model based on the qualification of the coastal cities as ""consume-less""ù locations and on the enhancement of this peculiarity through an innovative communication and territorial marketing campaign, both implemented by directly involving all interested actors (local authorities, tourism operators and service providers, tourists).  This will bring multiple benefits, that will be carefully monitored and accounted for through the use of a suitable set of indicators, based on the European Tourism Indicators System. Expected benefits are the reduction in water and energy consumption and waste generation, the enhancement of local products and natural resources, the increase in tourism flows and in tourists awareness on the importance of adopting environmentally sound lifestyles.

1;1;COWORKMed;Social Innovation Research On Coworking Clusters;Innovation is a territorial cooperation process involving different categories of stakeholders for the designing of new products and services. Innovation may therefore be considered as a response to the economic crisis. In many Mediterranean territories, independent workers sharing offices are increasingly co-designing innovative products with an observed high level of competitiveness and sustainability. Hence, addressing the  innovation gap  that characterizes Mediterranean territories, COWORKMed  will develop a new model of entrepreneurship and social innovation by favouring cooperation and operational bridging between public actors, universities, training centres and  mainstream  clusters together with civil society. COWORKMed will promote co-working processes and their transnational organization as a lever of social innovation in Mediterranean. Indeed, innovative products emerging from the cooperation of independent workers sharing offices could benefit more and better to  mainstream  clusters. Optimizing this contribution could also allow the transnational activity of key clusters through the implementation of a mobility scheme connecting ideas and people from co-working areas of the MED metropolitan areas.

1;1;CreaInnovation;CreaInnovation;In the EC MED strategic framework SMEs play a critical role in innovation and sustainable development in the Green sector. By adopting a ëcreative entrepreneurshipí approach to sustainable innovation, SMEs can tackle, cost effectively, many of the challenges faced in growing their business. Creativity, stimulated and developed through specific methods and processes, and the management of innovation are considered important factors for development processes, balanced growth and strengthening of a companyís profile. Mediterranean SMEs, often lacking in innovation capabilities, must be provided with the necessary creativity tools and practices. As systemic creativity support is a prerequisite for innovation development, the project will design, launch and test e-Labs for Creative Innovation engaging regional and transnational public entities, students, researchers and managers, designing and testing structured processes for new innovation supporting politics. In the e-Labs (CIeL) SMEs and public organizations will generate sustainable innovation ideas with flexible and innovative tools fostering their creativity and innovation. Managing creativity successfully will help organizations to tap into hidden capacity for growth and improved competitiveness. Since SMEs participate less in formal training and education, through CIeL, the project aims at overcoming these barriers so for these SME to experience a new way that drives their innovation processes on MED networking as well.;Chamber of Commerce of Viterbo;ITALY;1100;2nd call;01/02/2018;31/07/2020;Testing;1.182.477,50;200.855,00;1.627.450,00;85%;Green Growth

3;1;DestiMED;Mediterranean Ecotourism Destination: main components (joint planning, monitoring, management and promotion)for a governance system in Mediterranean protected areas;Tourism illustrates an important source of revenues and employment in the MED area. At the same time it implicates enormous negative impacts for nature and society.   Some years ago, the concept of ecotourism appeared. What does this imply for the MED area? Unfortunately not much. Despite increasing international efforts to create harmonized concepts, agreed definitions and quality standards are missing in the MED area. Due to the lack of coherent planning and monitoring and seriously perceived promotion, ecotourism in the MED does not yet constitute a real alternative.   This could be changed through a governance system for ecotourism in protected areas, e.g. constituted through a destination management organisation (DMO). Such DMO could harmonize quality standards and tools to monitor compliance, propose attractive ecotourism offers promoted through a lasting brand.   This is where the project DestiMED comes into play aiming to build pre-conditions for a DMO:   Firstly, it will further develop and test standards, offers and monitoring tools - forming the quality scheme of a future DMO. It will build on results of the MEET project that created and tested planning and marketing approaches. These will be enriched by a monitoring tool.   The offers and tools developed will subsequently be tested in pilot actions involving local actors as well as the local community. In parallel, a network (based on the MEET network) will serve as idea-smithy to further shape the DMO.;REGIONE LAZIO - Regional Parks Agency of Lazio;ITALY;145;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;2.006.000,00;119.000,00;2.500.000,00;85%;Sustainable Tourism

Management and networking of protected areas will be improved by capacity building activities and pilot implementation of innovative water quality monitoring solutions in several protected wetland locations across the programme area. Water quality monitoring will be improved by means of state-of-the-art ICT technology providing live, early warning messages directly from a sensor-equipped buoy, or by means of long-term monitoring based on satellite imagery processing. The primary end uses of the monitoring systems will be management bodies of the protected areas involved in the pilot activities. However, by means of transferring actions in the project and sustainable results, secondary end users will be other management bodies of protected areas across the Mediterranean.  The overall objective of the action is to improve monitoring, management and networking of protected areas through supporting scientific, technical and management knowledge in order to tackle the problem of incoherent and segregated management of protected areas as self-sustained units, which is believed to hamper protection and promotion of Mediterranean natural resources, as well as maintenance of biodiversity and natural ecosystems.;University of Rijeka, Faculty of Maritime studies;CROATIA;51000;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;1.262.821,51;227.420,90;1.753.226,36;85%;Biodiversity Protection

3;1;EMbleMatiC;Emblematic Mediterranean Mountains as Coastal destinations of excellence;What do Olympus, Etna and CanigÚ have in common? They are all coastal Mediterranean mountains, emblematic for their history, landscape and identity.   Today, 9 coastal mountains have joined the network of Emblematic Mediterranean Mountains: CanigÛ and Sainte Victoire (France), Etna and Gran Sasso (Italy), Olympus and Ida (Greece), Pedra Forca and Serra de Tramuntana (Spain) and Cik‡†  (Albania).  The objective of the EMbleMatiC project is to create and test a new and radically different tourism offer based on the features of these mountains and to create an alternative to the traditional holiday on the beach. This project goes even further. It is not concerned with creating a generic tourism product, but rather with piloting a new way of conceiving tourism: one which combines the development and protection of natural environments, by applying a more sustainable and responsible management of tourism flows and a greater involvement of inhabitants and local actors.   This project will contribute to re-balance tourist flows between the sea and the mountain, to extend the seasonality and to improve economic returns for the territories.   Several experiments will lead the territories toward the definition of an umbrella brand based on a sustainable and responsible tourism approach. Should the evaluation prove positive, more than fifteen other mountains from the MED basin could join the network together with their local authorities in order to evolve their tourism policies.;Syndicat Mixte CANIG” Grand Site;FRANCE;66500;1st call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Studying and Testing;2.402.168,44;127.067,35;2.975.571,49;85%;Sustainable Tourism

1;1;GREENOMED;Mediterranean Trans-Regional Cooperation for green manufacturing innovation;"Manufacturing is an important pillar for Europe, since it impacts significantly on economy, occupation welfare and environment. It consumes about the 30% of the total energy produced, uses as input critical raw materials and is responsible for environmental emissions. Thus, the adoption of green practices in manufacturing is a top-priority of several European Regions.  However, even if Europe is a global leader in green manufacturing research, its innovation capacity should be strongly improved. The availability of a European network of pilot plants accessible to SMEs could significantly contribute to this goal.  The setup such an interconnected network of pilot plants requires the identification of common challenges and the mobilization of considerable resources.

The project's transnational approach foresees extensive testing in representative pilot MED Cities in 6 Countries, of previously established methods for the conclusion of MED public building typologies accompanied with cost-optimal interventions and financial and gradual renovation plans. The results are organised into a transnational purpose web and GIS-based information system being a user-friendly decision making tool for affordable SEAPs with high impact. The tool is verified through small-scale renovation projects in each pilot City and further evaluated through targeted transferring activities.;CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND SAVING;GREECE;19009;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;1.711.214,90;178.218,65;2.222.863,00;85%;Efficient Buildings
3;1;INHERIT;SUSTAINABLE TOURISM STRATEGIES TO CONSERVE AND VALORISE THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL AND MARITIME NATURAL HERITAGE;INHERIT is an integrated project with 15 partners from all 10 MED countries aiming to conserve and valorise natural heritage in MED coastal and maritime tourist destinations. The project will test and deploy a new approach adapted to MED specificities protecting natural heritage from the adverse effects of intensive tourism. INHERIT will promote sustainable tourism alleviating seasonality and tackling the surpassing of the hosting capacity, by designing and implementing a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù protection approach relying on self-regulation and monitoring by local society and tourism stakeholders.   The INHERIT protection approach will involve all the key stakeholders (at MED, national, regional and local level) in its studying, testing and capitalisation activities, to deliver:  - A MED-wide policy strategy and protection measures addressing the negative effects of intensive tourism flows.  - MED INHERITURA sites, i.e. designated areas in which human activities coexist with substantial natural heritage, subscribing to the INHERIT protection approach and acting as models, to scale up and out the approach to other MED areas.   - A network and management mechanism of the INHERITURA sites, that will assume the sustainability and the scaling up after project completion.  - Thematic tourism routes (e.g. remote islands, prehistoric sites) will be pilot-integrated in the INHERITURA areas using the improved protection as an asset to increase tourism attractiveness in a sustainable way.;REGION OF PELOPONNESE;GREECE;22100;2nd call;01/02/2018;31/01/2022;Integrated project;4.643.601,00;127.160,00;5.612.660,00;85%;Sustainable Tourism

In rural areas and islands of MED regions, local fiscal policies have a key role in incresing renewable energy sources. Since rural local authorities have economical and technical constraints, RES promotion plans should prioritize collaboration and active roles for private sector and households. Local fiscal systems are proper tools to lead and engage such actors in RES.  The project will support the testing of innovative local green fiscal policies, and monitoring their results in spreading renewable energy sources. As well, the project will facilitate capitalization of the best practices and application in other municipalities, at national and transnational levels, since models of green local fiscal policy will be elaborated and disseminated as well as technical support will be provided. The project will provide Local Authorities with fiscal policy models to be included in their own strategies and plans, especially in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors.

2;3;LOCATIONS;Low Carbon Transport in Cruise Destination Cities;How cruise tourism can increase economic benefits in coastal regions, thus reducing its negative environmental impact?  Cruise tourism represents an appealing way to visit coastal areas providing a significant boost in their economy and international reputation.  Facing the need to increase income from cruise tourism and to preserve territorial natural assets, cities are called to use existing low carbon transport systems and multimodal connections.  LOCATIONS' (Low Carbon Transport in Cruise Destination Cities) overall objective is to support local public administrations in drafting Low-Carbon Transport and mobility Plans (LCTPs) with measures dedicated to cruise-related passengers and freight flows, contributing to decongest the city traffic and to lower the production of greenhouse gases.  A methodology will be tested to respond to specific mobility-related issues in the countries involved.  The definition of modular packages will pave the way for transferability in new MED area countries by means of international capacity building actions and mutual learning activities for new sustainable mobility concepts. New LCTPs will be produced and capitalization actions will grant the involvement of a broader number of cruise destinations to adopt the LOCATIONS approach by means of bankable projects.

1;1;MADRE;Metropolitan Agriculture for Developing an innovative, sustainable and Responsible Economy;According to the FAO, a paradigm shift in both urban and agriculture development, planning and policy formulation is required in order to ensure access to urban food security, improved environmental management and enhanced rural-urban linkages. Although recognized as a major lever of eco-innovation for metropolis' sustainability and competitiveness, metropolitan and periurban agriculture (MPA) still suffers from a  mainstreaming gap , remaining overlooked by policy makers, academic research and the general public. As a result, the environmental price of food is an invisible but nonetheless major burden for cities. The MADRE project aims to meet this challenge : supply MPA with key players (from the quadruple helix) and create a transnational cooperation in the MED aerea. Aiming at fostering a change process in the metropolitan food supply model, the project will capitalize on the wide set of academic knowledge, pilot actions and policies, networks and transnational cooperations in order to allow MPA reaching a critical level in the MED area. Indepth assessment of available material will provide the baseline for an empowerment of MPA stakeholders and then to a formal committment to initiate a transnational clustering processs.

Unfortunately, in the 8 countries covered by this project, the potential of cycling tourism has not yet been realised even though it prolongs the tourism season, reduces the environmental impact of travelling and can bring tourists to less visited areas. EuroVelo 8 ñ Mediterranean Route is a long-distance cycle route that connects the whole Mediterranean from Cyprus to C·diz. The overall objective of the project is to use this route as a tool to influence regional and national policies in favour of sustainable and responsible tourism, providing transnational solutions in coastal areas across the Mediterranean. The main outputs will be action plans and policy recommendations (to generate investments in the route conditions)  pilot actions (to test the proposed developments)  and updated information and promotion related to EuroVelo 8 (to attract visitors).  In this way, the project will benefit national, regional and local authorities, service providers and, ultimately, cycle tourists. Taking a transnational approach will enable common challenges (e.g. lack of route infrastructure, missing cycling friendly services, weak branding and promotion) to be tackled together and best practices to be shared, thereby avoiding duplication and increasing the effectiveness and positive social, economic and environmental impacts.;AGENCIA DE OBRA PUBLICA DE LA JUNTA DE ANDALUCIA.

In so doing, we will increase the sustainability and quality of life in  MED space. Our objective is to create tools and instruments for designing new sustainable culinary experiences, which will be offered to visitors to: 1) diversify the tourism sector in terms of products and its seasonality  2) bring tourism development to the coastal hinterland  3) safeguard culinary heritage for future generations. To achieve the stated objectives we will produce the following outputs:  - tools for enhancing sustainable tourist destinations by using culinary heritage as a resource - creation of eight new sustainable tourist destinations in MED space based on the culinary heritage - common transnational strategy on managing and planning culinary tourism in MED space. This approach is unique because MED culinary heritage initiatives are generally unconnected and to this day there have been only few common approaches developed to integrate the MED culinary heritage into a sustainable tourist offer. The methodology in MEDFEST is based on participatory action planning, where three main types of stakeholders (producers, tourism organisations, policy makers) are involved and take responsibility for project's actions from the beginning till the end to ensure the durability of the results.;Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts;SLOVENIA;1000;1st call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Studying and Testing;1.885.702,61;0,00;2.218.473,66;85%;Sustainable Tourism

Indeed, in the MED area, the majority of public buildings is not adequately designed to reduce their energy consumption and improve their EE performance. This is partly due to a lack of awareness of owners and managers and knowledge gaps regarding common answers to this transnational challenge. Thus the overall objective of MEDNICE is to empower MED projects' partners through the establishment of a MED community and a joint transnational framework around energy efficiency in public buildings. By setting up training and peer learning mechanisms, MEDNICE will contribute to increase the capacity of owners and managers of public buildings to design and implement better energy efficiency practices. It will set up a knowledge platform that will allow for capitalizing and communicating results and outputs of the modular projects. It will serve as a cornerstone of a transnational peer network laying the ground for a MED identity. MEDNICE will also analyze and summarize EE practices through thematic and policy papers to be promoted and benefit the MED community.

Marine litter is a global threat for living marine organisms. Over 260 species have so far been reported to ingest or become entangled in debris such as plastic, monofilament line, rubber and aluminium foil The problem particularly affects fishes, cetaceans and marine turtles, animals in whose digestive tracts commonly appear accidentally-swallowed micro and macro plastic debris.  The Marine Strategy Framework Directive considers marine litter as one of the most concerning causes of pollution of the sea and states that the Good Environmental State is reached when ""properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment""ù. Similar consideration has been done by the Mediterranean Countries that adopted the Barcelona Convention in which ensuring that marine litter does not affect biodiversity and ecosystem services has been incorporated as a main ecological objective.   Although many Mediterranean organisations are working on this issue, there is not any widely-accepted protocols to assess pollution by marine litter. For this reasons, the project proposes to network representative MPAs, scientific organizations and environmental NGOs for developing, testing and delivering efficient, easy to apply and cost-effective protocols to monitor and manage litter impact on biodiversity.";Cinque Terre National Park and Marine Protected Area;ITALY;19017;1st call;01/11/2016;31/07/2019;Studying and Testing;2.042.330,55;0,00;2.402.741,83;85%;Biodiversity Protection

3;2;MPA-ADAPT;Guiding Mediterranean MPAs through the climate change era: Building resilience and adaptation;The Mediterranean Sea climate will undergo rapid changes over the next decades.  Direct evidence of climate change (CC) is already being observed at Mediterranean coast, including marine protected areas (MPAs). The need for building resilience in both social and ecological aspects of MPAs, through taking on adaptive management thus becomes an essential element for mitigating against and adjusting to the rapid changes to maintain and protect healthy ecosystems. However, CC is not explicit incorporated in most management plans and information to assist MPA decision making is both limited and fragmented.  The goals of the MPA-Adapt are to develop collaborative and site-specific adaptation plans for the MPAs that enhance resilience to CC impacts. This will be achieved by building capacity for effective management, assessing risks  and exploring potential actions and priorities needed to ensure the adaptability and the resilience of biodiversity and the local communities. It also aims to incorporate CC vulnerability assessments and nature-based adaptation planning into their existing management framework, and provide guidance to MPA managers and local stakeholders to implement and test climate-change approaches.

3;2;POSBEMED;Sustainable management of the systems Posidonia-beaches in the Mediterranean region;Residues of seagrass Posidonia oceanica beached in tourist zones represent often a problem in the Mediterranean. Similarly to seagrass meadows, the leaf debris help to reduce the swell's energy and can act as a seedbank for dune formation increasing the overall resilience of the coast to natural and climate change effects. However, to ensure that the coasts and beaches remain attractive for tourism, tones of this material are removed and disposed by administrations in many coastal areas, including protected areas (PA). There is a lack of public awareness of the benefits of this natural capital and a strong need for strengthening PA management capacity with adequate guidelines on how to effective manage it. Several local studies and EU projects have evaluated the ecosystem services that Posidonia and its structures, called banquettes, offer, developed tools for the management of banquettes and new ways to use them. By integrating these results and providing a transnational overview of the management practices, the perceptions of stakeholders across Mediterranean, POSBEMED aims to define a transnational joint management strategy for Posidonia beach/dunes systems.

Public authorities will be mobilized leading to their engagement in sustainable energy strategy implementation in their jurisdictions with a truly long-term vision in mind.The MED, as the natural place for PV and where grid parity is a reality, has the opportunity to pioneer in testing such technologies in real time with authorities ready to contribute.This endeavour will increase socio-economic competitiveness of regions involved most importantly will have an international impact as new knowledge for optimum PV-ESS interoperability is transferred to a broader geographical context where grid parity has not reached yet.;UNIVERSITY OF CYPRUS - FOSS Research Centre for Sustainable Energy, PV Technology Lab;CYPRUS;1678;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;1.692.415,67;0,00;1.991.077,25;85%;Renewable Energy
2;3;SUMPORT;Sustainable Urban Mobility in MED PORT cities;All EU cities are confronted with similar challenges related to mobility, i.e. urban congestion, pollution, GHG emissions and the consequent need to improve the mobility and air quality in a context of enduring economic crisis. Yet, MED cities having ports are defied with even more complex issues, needing a long-term mobility planning approach, integrating both city- and port-originated transport flows, in order to achieve sustainable urban mobility.  SUMPORT aims at tackling this situation through the following activities and outputs:  - strengthening the MED port cities' knowledge and planning capacities through trainings for MED port city officials in drafting SUMPs, also benefitting from MED port cities already having them  - drafting SUMPs in two MED port cities and updating one already existing   - implementing pilot actions and small-scale investments for sustainable mobility in six MED port cities.  The common mobility challenges of MED port cities require, and SUMPORT will provide, a strong transnational participatory approach, exchanging experiences and expertise, with those already having SUMPs participating in the training of those who do not, and comparing how SUMPs are translated into concrete actions. Tools will be developed for transferring the gained knowledge and results to a wider MED audience.  While several projects have been carried out on SUMPs in EU Programmes other than MED, SUMPORT is the first one tackling urban mobility planning in MED port cities.;Central European Initiative;ITALY;34121;1st call;01/02/2017;31/07/2019;Testing;1.724.487,81;280.457,50;2.358.759,20;85%;Urban Transports
1;1;SYNGGI;Synergies for Green Growth Initiative-Energising the Impact of Innovation in the Mediterranean;SYNGGI aims to support the modular approved projects under the objective Green Growth of the priority Axis 1. Innovation of the Interreg MED Programme. The activities will support the sub-objective 1.1 and especially the Green Growth sub-priority, in order to serve the targets and strategies of the Managing Authorities for the MED Area. The project has been designed as an agile tool that will unify project results, support MED stakeholders and create a fruitful and collaborative environment for all implicated bodies.  Additionally the project will fully comply with the Interreg-MED strategy according to which the Horizontal projects will act as a bridge between the Modular projects, the Governance project- platform - of Axis 4 and the EU policy makers. The consortium members are powerful actors  networks or clusters of private and public character and have been chosen so that they can create a vast network of key groups including SMEs, academics, research institutes and governing authorities (Quadruple helix representatives).  SYNGGI has been structured to support communication, capitalization activities and at the same time it aims beyond MED territories, across all EU countries, as deemed fit by the Programme Authorities. That way the project is a valuable adjustable partner for the Interreg Programme, ready to answer to its needs and offer innovative solutions that will produce unified results and solid proposals for environmental policies.;FundaciÛ Universit‡ria Balmes;SPAIN;8500;2nd call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Horizontal project;1.071.383,23;50.591,75;1.319.970,56;85%;Green Growth
1;1;TALIA;Territorial Appropriation of Leading-edge Innovation Actions;Over the past few years, the MED stakeholder community has built a growing awareness of the need to go beyond fragmented, one-off projects and explore their potential for scalability in a much more effective and consistent way. By scalability, we mean the capacity of project results to reach a greater number of beneficiaries over time and space, impacting on the thematic policy and practice AS-IS in a transformative manner. In response, during the preparation of the new programming period 2014-2020, there has been much talk and some action on new and innovative approaches to the capitalisation of successful pilot projects at Member State, Regional, and Macro Regional level. Particularly the MEDCAP CreativeMED White Paper proposed to set the focus on the Mediterranean as an original ëlandscapeí that blends together different types of innovation ñ scientific, industrial, social, and institutional ñ in a relatively unexplored fashion, with the explicit goal of promoting ëtriple loopí learning as a step towards achieving sustainability and impact of piloted MED innovations at scale. However, many questions remain unanswered on the practical implications of pursuing a systematic scaling up approach and how the policy and practice dimensions relate to each other. TALIA aims to fulfil the MED horizontal call requirements while at the same time developing and implementing the CreativeMED learning concept directly with the territorial actors and stakeholders concerned.;Apulia Region - Department of Economic Development, Innovation, Education, Training and Employment;SPAIN;70121;2nd call;01/11/2016;31/10/2019;Horizontal project;1.300.831,50;66.852,50;1.609.040,00;85%;Social and Creative
2;1;TEESCHOOLS;TEESCHOOLS;The target of the EU of reducing by 20% its total emissions within 2020 has activated actions both in private and public sector. Renovation of buildings emerges as an urgent issue, but there is lack of knowledge on performance/cost characteristics of advanced component and systems for efficient renovation of buildings. Moreover, while incentives are given to private sector, Local Authorities face severe limitations of budget. TEESCHOOLS aims at providing new solutions to Local Authorities both in technical and financial terms to implement Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) renovation activities in Mediterranean Schools. The innovative approach consists in setting up an integrated set of user friendly but scientifically sound tools: a pre-audit tool for simplify the energy audits,  a carbon footprint calculator based on the building life cycle information,  an innovative database of BAT for renovation of school buildings  tailored financing models and highly qualified trainings. These tools will be tested in all partner countries and will be adapted and harmonized with the objective to be used in local, regional and national energy plans. An expert transnational working team will support the pilots and blended learning models will help enhancing capacity in public sector. The transnational and multidisciplinary expertise of the partnership will be a fundamental asset to consolidate the knowledge of local energy managers.;ENEA - Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (Roma);ITALY;187;1st call;01/02/2017;31/01/2020;Testing and Capitalising;2.235.500,00;178.500,00;2.840.000,00;85%;Efficient Buildings
3;1;TOURISMED;PÍche Tourisme pour un dÈveloppement durable dans la rÈgion mÈditerranÈenne;TOURISMED is a project aimed at testing and transferring a fishing tourism business model in the coastal territories of Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Albania, France and Spain as a way to promote a sustainable approach to tourism, while fostering the preservation of the marine ecosystem and traditional fishing culture of the MED region.  These areas face the common challenge of finding new solutions for the worrying depletion of marine resources, the decline of the artisanal fishing sector and the negative impacts of tourism such as social dislocation, loss of cultural heritage and ecological degradation. As a response, the project objective is to promote fishing tourism as a sustainable coastal and maritime tourism practice in the MED area.  Expected changes concern an improved use of resources by artisanal fishers, a diversification of income in the sector and a better valorisation of coastal traditional heritage and local seafood.  The project will produce a pilot test of the model and an evaluation tool to assess its replication in the concerned area. A training course will involve fishermen to implement the touristic itineraries in synergy with local tourism operators. The final model will be promoted by a web tool to clients willing to set up a fishing tourism business, while an interactive map of itineraries will be used to reach tourists. Protocols with public bodies and fishing associations (MoU) will be followed by policy recommendations to ensure sustainability of project's impacts.;Municipality of Trabia;ITALY;90019;1st call;01/02/2017;31/07/2019;Testing;1.601.722,50;98.897,50;2.157.900,00;79%;Sustainable Tourism
3;2;WETNET;Coordinated management and networking of Mediterranean wetlands;Wetlands in Europe are vulnerable interconnected environments, hugely contributing to biodiversity. Their protection intertwines scientific-environmental aspects and governance concerns. WETNET tackles the issue of implementing a multilevel governance for MED wetlands in order to achieve overall and network effects on wetlands ecosystems as well as on connected local systems.   The project aims at ensuring higher coordination between different levels of spatial planning and authorities in charge for their management, whilst limiting conflicts between preservation issues and economic activities. By defining common priorities for MED wetlands conservation, WETNET builds a common territorial strategy for their integrated management. Building on previous EU experiences (River Contracts), WETNET seeks to test and transfer ëWetlands Contracts', acting through broad participatory processes where users, private and public entities are committed in mainstreaming wetlands preservation into their ordinary activities. To this aims, the project will also:  -increase the knowledge on River Contracts effectiveness   -strengthen existing transnational networks for sharing and disseminating information and good practices on wetlands preservation.  The project partnership involves all authorities and typology of stakeholders operating in target field.  It will allow WETNET  to meet the Wetlands needs at a broad scale, ensuring the transferability of its results to other EU countries.;Veneto region - Strategic territorial planning and cartography;ITALY;30123;1st call;01/11/2016;30/04/2019;Testing;1.914.239,10;0,00;2.252.046,00;85%;Biodiversity Protection
